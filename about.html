          <h1> <strong> Our Mission </strong></h1>
          <h2>The average price for a sefer is around $17 dollars per book. Over time that can add up to a signifigant sum
          money for a student. The creators of this website saw a need to create a fund dedicated to distributing sefarim to
        students who may not have the extra cash nessesary to purchase the books that are so critical for their learning.</h2>
          <h2>About Us:</h2>
          <h3> We are a group of inquisitive students who love to learn and have cultivated a strong passion for learning. We have
          been studying in Jewish educational institutions for all of our lives and have felt the tremdous impact of Jewish learing
          on our lives and firmly belive in the power of the individual to learn and explore on their own. The world is a place filled with
            many questions and it is refreshing in an increasingly complicated world to know that those before you have thought of these same exact questions
              and written and elaborated on the very topics in question. Sefarim are the key to unlocking the wisdom of past generations by giving us a glimpse in to
                the thoughts and minds of the most illustrious minds of the previous generations.  </h3>
